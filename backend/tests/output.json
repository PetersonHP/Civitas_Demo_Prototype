        "comment_body": "Thank you for reporting the illegal dumping on Brook Avenue near East 138th Street. We take unauthorized waste disposal seriously as it affects neighborhood quality of life and public health. We will dispatch a sanitation crew to remove the furniture and appliances. Due to current database connectivity issues, manual crew assignment is required. You can typically expect removal within 3-7 business days for cases like this."
