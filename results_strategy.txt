Looking at your situation - you have a working app but need results by Sunday morning for your Princeton CS IW presentation. Here's a focused plan to get meaningful results in ~2.5 days:

## Immediate Action Plan (Time-Boxed)

### Friday (12 hours of work)
**Create a Test Dataset & Benchmark Performance**

1. **Generate 30-50 realistic test tickets** (3 hours)
   - Cover all ticket types: potholes, stray animals, broken equipment, etc.
   - Include edge cases: unclear descriptions, wrong locations, etc.
   - Save ground truth labels (correct priority, crew type, status)

2. **Run automated evaluation** (4 hours)
   - Process all tickets through your AI
   - Measure:
     - **Classification accuracy**: Does AI pick right crew type? (% correct)
     - **Priority assignment accuracy**: Correct priority level? (% correct)
     - **Response time**: How fast does system process a ticket? (seconds)
     - **Dispatch optimization**: Distance from assigned crew to location (miles)
   - Compare AI suggestions vs. manual baseline (what a human dispatcher would do)

3. **Collect system metrics** (2 hours)
   - Average API response times
   - Database query performance
   - Success/failure rates for AI operations

### Saturday (8 hours of work)
**User Testing & Qualitative Feedback**

4. **Get 8-10 users to test** (6 hours)
   - Friends, classmates, anyone available
   - Give them scenarios: "Report a pothole", "Dispatch this ticket"
   - Use **System Usability Scale (SUS)** - standard 10-question survey
   - Collect: completion time, error rates, qualitative feedback

5. **Create case studies** (2 hours)
   - Pick 3 compelling examples showing full workflow
   - Before/after comparisons (traditional vs. Civitas)

### Sunday Morning (2 hours)
**Package Results**

6. **Create results visualizations**
   - Bar charts: AI accuracy metrics
   - Table: Performance comparison
   - User satisfaction scores
   - Screenshots of successful dispatches

## Key Metrics to Present

**Quantitative:**
- AI Classification Accuracy: X% correct crew assignments
- Priority Assignment: X% agreement with ground truth
- Average Processing Time: X seconds per ticket
- SUS Score: X/100 (68+ is above average)

**Qualitative:**
- "Users found the interface intuitive" (3.8/5 average rating)
- "AI suggestions were helpful X% of the time"
- Case studies showing successful end-to-end scenarios

## Realistic Expectations

For an IW project with 2.5 days:
- **Don't aim for perfection** - 70%+ accuracy is good for a prototype
- **Small sample size is OK** - 30 test tickets and 8 users is sufficient for IW
- **Focus on demonstrating value** - show it works better than manual process
- **Acknowledge limitations** - be honest about what still needs work

This gives you concrete numbers to put in your "Results" section while being achievable in your timeframe. Want me to help you create the test dataset or evaluation scripts?
